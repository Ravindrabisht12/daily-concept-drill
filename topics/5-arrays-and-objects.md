# Arrays and Objects

## Overview
Arrays and objects are fundamental data structures in JavaScript.

## Arrays
- Ordered collections of values
- Can store any type of data

## Objects
- Unordered collections of key-value pairs
- Keys are strings (or Symbols)

## Examples
```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let mixed = [1, "two", true, null];

let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
let car = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2020 };
```

## Explanation
- Use arrays for ordered lists, objects for structured data.
- Access array elements by index, object properties by key.
- Arrays have methods like `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`.
- Objects can be nested and hold functions as values.
